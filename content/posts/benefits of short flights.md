Are you planning a trip to India or somewhere accross the world and wondering how to get there? As an Indian living in the US, I have to make this journey quite often to visit friends, family and also conduct some business. While it may be tempting to just book a long haul flight and get it over with, I've found that breaking up the journey with shorter flights can actually be a much more enjoyable and rewarding experience.

Don't get me wrong, I've taken my fair share of long haul flights in the past. But as I've gotten older and experienced the joys of legroom (or lack thereof) and the thrill of being stuck in a cramped cabin for hours on end, I've come to the realization that I'm done with them. Luckily, by planning flights that are just six hours or less, it's possible to reach almost any destination on commercial airlines without having to endure an entire day in the air. 

Of course, breaking up your trip will take longer and require multiple flights, but the benefits are worth it. Not only will you get to experience new places that you might have otherwise missed, but you'll also reduce your risk of health issues associated with long haul flights. On my own journeys to India, I've had the chance to visit many countries in Europe and Asia along the way.

One of my favorites and usually first stops is Iceland, with its stunning landscapes and endless opportunities for outdoor adventure. Whether it was hiking through the rugged terrain or camping under the Northern Lights, I was constantly amazed by the beauty of this unique country. I enjoyed hiking in the martianesque landscape with steam coming out of the ground and geothermal pools scattered around. The therapuetic effects of the natural sulfur rich waters are a great benefit when visiting iceland. You can drive around the country for long days of  hiking, camping and relaxing  at differnt geothermal pools and spas. One of my favorite partrs about camping in iceland is the lack of dangerous animals.

The Netherlands was also a great destination, with its picturesque countryside and excellent opportunities for walking and biking. From exploring the canals of Amsterdam to taking in the tulip fields of Keukenhof, I was never short on things to do in this charming country. The cafes are definitely a must to visit, although we may have something like it in the US soon... The Dutch are all about their bikes and the next time I visit, I'll be bringing mine and touring all around on their marvelous bike routes and fully experiencing their bike friendly society. 

Of course, no trip to Europe would be complete without a stop in Berlin, which was just as crazy as I had hoped it would be. From the fast-moving autobahns to the legendary nightlife, Berlin was an unforgettable destination.

And then there's London, which is usually my first stop on the way to India. From exploring the iconic landmarks of the city to indulging in some of the best food and drink in the world, there was never a dull moment in this cosmopolitan capital. London is a vibrant and exciting city with a rich history and culture. It is known for its iconic landmarks such as Big Ben, the Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace, which are popular tourist attractions that offer a glimpse into the city's past. In addition to its historical and cultural sites, London is also known for its diverse food scene, with a range of international cuisines available at its many restaurants and food markets. From traditional English pub food to global flavors, there is something for everyone in London's culinary landscape.

On another trip, I decided to stop in Hong Kong on my way to India, which was an absolute sensory overload. From the hustling streets of Kowloon to the towering skyscrapers of Hong Kong Island, there was always something new and exciting to discover in this vibrant city. Hong Kong is a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant energy and unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures. As one of the world's most densely populated cities, it is a place where traditional temples and markets coexist alongside towering skyscrapers and modern shopping centers. It was quite the experience to have lunch at the top floor of the Ritz Carlton over 100 floors up. The shopping malls were incredible. There were so many shopping centers that it seemed each skyscrapper had its own mall.

The city is made up of two main areas: Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula. Hong Kong Island is home to the city's financial district and many of its most iconic landmarks, including Victoria Harbour and the Peak, which offers panoramic views of the city. The Kowloon Peninsula is known for its crowded streets, lively markets, and colorful nightlife.

There is always something new and exciting to discover in Hong Kong, whether you're exploring its bustling streets, trying out its delicious food, or experiencing its vibrant nightlife. The city is a melting pot of cultures, with a range of international cuisines available at its many restaurants and food markets. From Cantonese dim sum to Indian curry, there is something for every taste in Hong Kong.

In addition to its many cultural attractions, Hong Kong is also a great destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with a range of hiking and cycling trails that offer breathtaking views of the city and the surrounding countryside. So whether you're looking to experience the city's vibrant culture, sample its delicious food, or explore its beautiful natural surroundings, Hong Kong is a must-visit destination for any traveler.

In the end, whether you choose to take a long haul flight or break up your journey with shorter flights, the most important thing is to find the option that works best for you. But for me, breaking up long flights has been a great way to see more of the world and have a more rewarding travel experience. So the next time you're planning a trip to India, consider breaking up your journey and discover all the amazing places that are waiting for you along the way.

It's also important to consider the cost and convenience of your travel arrangements when planning a trip. While breaking up your journey with multiple flights may offer more opportunities to explore new destinations, it may also be more expensive and require more planning and coordination. On the other hand, a long haul flight may be more convenient and cost-effective, and allow for more exploration and cultural immersion at the final destination for anyone that has a limited amount of time for their trips. Ultimately, the best option will depend on your personal preferences and budget.
