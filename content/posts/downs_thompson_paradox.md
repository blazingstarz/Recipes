# Why aren't all cities built for cyclists and where should we go?

As a bicycle enthusiast, I am very drawn to the idea of living in a city that has excelent pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. Living in America, I am missing out on some of the safe cycling paths that pedestrian focused cities have. In all of the cities I've lived in, most of the protected bike lanes were just simple painted lines without any real dividers to keep cars out. As I grow older, I want to enjoy the health benefits of human powered transportation to get to my daily destinations. On the search for bike friendly cities, I learned about this one paradox that explains why the cities I live in haven't gotten safer for cyclists and why most people in America choose to have cars. I'm a big car guy, but prefer to enjoy them for recreation. 

The Downs-Thomson Paradox is a concept in urban planning that states that as a city grows larger in population, the average commute time for residents will actually increase, even though the city's transportation infrastructure also increases. This paradox is named after Anthony Downs and Peter G. Thompson, who first proposed the concept in the 1960s.

The explanation for this paradox is that as the population of a city increases, the number of destinations that people want to travel to also increases. This leads to more traffic congestion on the roads and longer commute times, even if the city's transportation infrastructure is expanding. Additionally, as more people move to a city, the urban land becomes more valuable and therefore more expensive, leading to urban sprawl, which means that people live further away from their place of work, making commutes even longer.

The Downs-Thomson Paradox has important implications for city planning. It suggests that simply building more roads and expanding transportation infrastructure may not be an effective solution to reducing commute times, as it may actually encourage more people to move to the city, leading to increased traffic congestion. Instead, city planners should focus on creating compact and dense urban areas, where people can live, work, and play in close proximity to one another, reducing the need for long commutes.

To mitigate this paradox smart growth or compact cities, transportation demand management, and land-use planning that increase the density and mix of housing, retail, and office developments near public transit stations and corridors, are some of the methodologies that city planners can use, they also can enhance the use of public transportation, cycling and walking, and reduce dependence on cars.

## What is smart growth in relation to the Downs-Thompson Paradox?

Smart growth is a concept of urban planning that emphasizes the creation of compact and walkable communities that are designed to reduce dependence on cars and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, walking, and cycling. This can be achieved by increasing the density and mix of housing, retail, and office developments near public transit stations and corridors in contrast to having vast areas of residential zoned districts farther away from business and retail zoned areas.

By creating compact and dense urban areas, smart growth can reduce the need for long commutes. When people live, work, and play in close proximity to one another, they are less likely to need to travel long distances to reach their destinations.

Additionally, smart growth also promotes walkable communities, which further reduces the need to use cars, by providing safe and accessible sidewalks, bike lanes, and public spaces, also it can help to reduce urban sprawl and discourage people from living far away from their place of work.

## How does the Downs-Thomson Paradox influence the use of cycling and walking as transportation options in cities?

The Downs-Thomson Paradox can influence the use of cycling and walking as transportation options in cities in a couple of ways.

First, as traffic congestion and commute times increase due to population growth and urban sprawl, people may be more likely to consider alternative modes of transportation such as cycling and walking. With longer commute times, people may be less willing to spend a significant portion of their day sitting in traffic, and may instead look for more efficient and sustainable ways of getting around.

Second, Smart growth urban planning which is a methodology that helps to mitigate the Downs-Thomson Paradox, also encourages cycling and walking as transportation options by providing safe and accessible sidewalks, bike lanes, and public spaces. As a result, cycling and walking become more viable transportation options. By creating compact and dense urban areas, city planners can reduce the need for long commutes, and increase the number of destinations that are within walking and biking distance.

On the other hand, the Downs-Thomson Paradox can also discourage the use of cycling as transportation option. When people live further away from their place of work and other destinations, they may be less likely to consider cycling or walking and opt for a car, as the distances involved may be too great some days. Additionally, in sprawling cities, it is often difficult to find safe and accessible routes for cycling and walking

## What are the best designed cities in the context of the Downs-Thompson Paradox?

It is difficult to say which cities are the "best designed" in the context of the Downs-Thomson Paradox, as the effectiveness of a city's design depends on a wide range of factors, including population density, land use patterns, transportation infrastructure, and local political and economic conditions. However, there are some cities around the world that have been recognized for their effective design in addressing the downs-Thomson Paradox.

One example of a city that has been recognized for its smart growth approach to urban planning is Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is known for its compact and efficient design, which includes a well-developed public transportation system and a network of pedestrian-friendly streets. The city has implemented an efficient bus rapid transit system that runs on dedicated lanes, which reduced the time required to cross the city from one end to the other from an hour to around 20 minutes. Additionally, the city has implemented an integrated land-use and transportation planning approach, which has resulted in a more efficient use of land, reduced dependence on cars and increased the use of public transit, cycling and walking.

In Europe, Copenhagen is considered as one of the best designed cities in terms of cycling infrastructure, with more than 40% of all trips made by bike. The city has implemented a comprehensive network of bike lanes, bike parking, and bike sharing systems, making cycling a convenient and safe transportation option. The city also has a well-developed public transportation system which allows citizens to reach most places within the city within 20 minutes, which reduces the need to own a car.

Bremen, a city in Northern Germany has a well-developed public transportation system, including buses and trams, which allows citizens to reach most places within the city within 20 minutes, which helps to reduce congestion and decrease commute times. Additionally, the city has implemented a comprehensive network of bike lanes and paths, making cycling a convenient and safe transportation option.

The Netherlands, in general, is known for its comprehensive and well-designed cycling infrastructure. Dutch cities have implemented a comprehensive network of bike lanes and paths, as well as bike-sharing systems that make cycling a convenient and safe transportation option. The Netherlands also has a well-developed public transportation system, including buses and trains that cover most of the country. The Netherlands also have a strong emphasis on sustainable transportation, with a focus on active mobility (cycling and walking), which helps to reduce dependence on cars, and decrease commute times. The Netherlands also have a well-implemented land-use planning approach, which encourages compact and sustainable urban development, by increasing the density and mix of housing, retail, and office developments near public transit stations and corridors.

Another example, Singapore is well-known for its efficient and sustainable transportation system, which is designed to reduce dependence on cars. The city-state has implemented an integrated land-use and transportation planning approach, which has resulted in a more efficient use of land, and created a network of high-density residential areas, mixed-use developments, and commercial centers that are well-served by public transit. The city has a comprehensive and reliable public transport system, including buses and trains that cover most of the island, which helps to reduce congestion and decrease commute times.

## Staying safe on the road without dedicated bike paths:

For now, when I venture out on my bicycle, it is usually for exercise. It is not to ofter that I use it for commuting as my work may be 5-10 miles from where I live depending on the day. My city is not particulary friendly to cyclists so I always make sure to wear proper equipment to keep me safe.  I prefer to have a very bright headlight. The [Garmin Varia UT800 #ad](https://amzn.to/3GDbLqi) is great because it pair well with my computer. One of my favorite peices of cycling tech is probably the [Garmn Varia Tail Light #ad](https://amzn.to/3XqZ20M). Combined with this [Small Helmet Mirror #ad](https://amzn.to/3vTjXOu), I pretty much always know if something is behind me. Without the radar, those Teslas and wild Prius drivers could sneak up on me. The Garmin radar tail light will even let you know if you need to pedal harder to keep your lead position if someone is trying to over take you. During the day time, I wear [Hi-Viz Jerseys #ad](https://amzn.to/3ZtCmyV) and at night, I wear [Reflective #ad](https://amzn.to/3X6sTMh) clothing.

## Some of the fitness tech I use on the road:

For my cycling computer, I am using the[ Garmin Edge series #ad](https://amzn.to/3Ztkioq). I also combine this with the [Garmin Heartrate Strap #ad](https://amzn.to/3IHeO3u) and [Power Meter Pedals #ad](https://amzn.to/3CIEhWC) to get all of the fitness information I need.
