## Ingredients

-   1 bunch of kale

-   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

-   1/8 teaspoon kosher salt

-   1 clove crushed garlic

-   1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Directions

1. Rinse kale under cold water. Remove stems, roll leaves, and slice into thin ribbons.
2. Place kale ribbons into a salad spinner to remove any excess water. This is important if you want your dressing to adhere to the kale leaves.
3. Transfer the kale to a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil, then add salt, garlic and lemon juice.
4. Gently massage all the ingredients into the kale using your hands. If the kale is very tender, you can simply toss with tongs (no massage required!).
5. Enjoy as-is or add your favorite salad toppings.
