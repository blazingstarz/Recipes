## Ingredients

-   1 unbaked frozen 9-inch pie crust*

-   1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped pecans 180g

-   1 cup dark corn syrup 240mL/350g

-   3/4 cup granulated sugar 150g

-   3 large eggs

-   4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted (57g)

-   2 teaspoons vanilla extract

-   3/4 teaspoon salt

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425F.
2. Place the frozen pie crust on a baking sheet and fill it with the chopped pecans.
3. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the corn syrup, sugar, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, and salt until well combined. Pour over the pecans. (If desired, place additional pecan halves on top in a decorative pattern.)
4. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350F. Continue baking for 35 to 40 minutes or until the filling is puffed and the center wobbles slightly when gently shaken. Loosely tent with foil at any time during baking if the crust is browning too quickly. Let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.  

Note: *If using my homemade pie crust recipe, youâ€™ll make two 9-inch pie crusts worth of dough. You can tightly wrap and freeze one disc of dough for up to 3 months- just thaw in the fridge for 24 hours before using. Roll out the pie dough, fill the pie pan and crimp the edge as desired. Freeze for at least 20 minutes before making the pecan pie recipe.
