## Ingredients

-   3 lbs shredded green papaya

-   1 medium carrot thinly sliced

-   1 small red bell pepper julienne

-   3/4 cups raisins

-   1 head garlic sliced

-   4 thumbs ginger julienne

-   2 cups vinegar

-   1 1/3 cups granulated white sugar

-   1 teaspoon salt

-   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Soak tha papaya in:

-   5 cups water

-   4 tablespoons salt

## Directions

1. Combine water and 4 tablespoons salt in a mixing bowl. Stir.
2. Add the shredded papaya. Cover and place inside the refrigerator. Soak for 2 days.
3. Put the papaya in a cheesecloth in a way that it is trapped in the center. Gently rotate the cheesecloth while tightly holding one end. Continue to rotate until the papaya completely releases liquid. Do this more than once for better results.
4. Arrange the papaya in a mixing bowl. Add all the vegetables and raisin. Toss and set aside.
5. Make the syrup by heating the vinegar in a cooking pot. Once it starts to boil, add sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well and cook for 1 to 3 minutes.
6. Put the papaya mixture in a mason jar. Do not completely fill the jar, leave a little space for the syrup.
7. Gently pour the hot syrup in each jar. Quickly close the lid. This will somewhat cook the papaya and veggies and will make it a bit softer.
8. Let it cool and then refrigerate, or simply store in a shelf in room temperature.
9. Serve with Lechon Kawali and Crispy Pata.
