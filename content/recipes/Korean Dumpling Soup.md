## Ingredients

-   1/2 pound beef brisket (about 230 grams), cut into small pieces

-   8 cups of water

-   3 garlic cloves, minced

-   2 green onions, sliced (or 1/2 cup sliced large green onion (dae-pa)

-   14 homemade shrimp & Asian chive dumplings (or any store bought frozen dumplings)

-   1 tablespoon fish sauce

-   1 egg, beaten in a small bowl

-   1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

-   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Bring 8 cups of water to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Add brisket and garlic to the boiling water. Cover and turn the heat down to medium
3. Boil for 30 minutes. Taste a piece of brisket to check if it’s tender or not. If it’s still a little tough, add more water and cook longer, until the beef turns tender.
4. Add 14 dumplings and turn up the heat to medium-high. Cook until all the dumplings are floating to the surface and have turned translucent. If you use freshly made dumplings, it will take about 7 minutes, but if you use frozen dumplings straight out of the freezer, it will take longer, between 10 to 12 minutes.
5. Add fish sauce and green onion, stir it gently and let it cook for 1 minute.
6. Pour the beaten egg over top of the soup and let it cook for about 20 seconds. Stir it gently.
7. Add sesame oil and ground black pepper.
8. Remove from the heat and serve right away with kimchi and a few more side dishes.
