## Ingredients

-   2 liter milk (full cream)

-   2 tbsp lemon juice

-   1 cup sugar

-   5 cups of water

-   3 pods of cardamom

## Directions

1. Firstly, in a large vessel, get 2 liter of milk to a boil, stirring occasionally.
2. Once the milk comes to a boil, pour 2 tbsp lemon juice and stir well. You can alternatively use curd or vinegar.
3. Stir until the milk curdles. Keep the flame on low to medium.
4. Do not boil further once water separates completely.
5. Drain the curdled milk over a cloth lined over a colander. You can use the leftover water to make soup or knead the dough as they are very nutritious.
6. Squeeze off the water completely. Be careful as the curdled milk will be very hot.
7. Rinse off the curdled milk with fresh water to remove sourness from lemon juice.
8. Squeeze off the water completely. Do not over squeeze as the moisture in paneer will be lost.
9. Hang for 1 hour to make sure the water is drained completely, yet remain the moisture.
10. After 1 hour, start to mash the paneer for 5 minutes.
11. Mash the paneer until it turns out smooth texture without any grains of paneer.
12. Now, prepare small ball-sized paneer and keep aside. Cover to prevent from drying.
13. In a large vessel, take 1 cup sugar, 5 cups of water, and 3 pods of cardamom.
14. Stir and dissolve the sugar completely.
15. Now, boil the water for 5 minutes.
16. Drop in rolled paneer balls one by one into boiling sugar water.
17. Cover and boil for 10 minutes or until rasgulla doubles in size.
18. Once cooked, drop into ice-cold water immediately to prevent from shrinking in size.
19. Once cooled completely, take into a serving bowl and pour in leftover sugar water.
20. Finally, enjoy rasgulla chilled or as it is.
