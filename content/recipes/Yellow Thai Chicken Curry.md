## Ingredients

-   1 pound boneless and skinless chicken, cut into 1.5 inch pieces (can also use chicken breast)

-   1 large shallot or onion, cut into strips

-   1 pound of potatoes, cut into quarters

-   1 tbsp. of vegetable oil

-   3 tbsps. of Aroy-D yellow curry paste

-   1 can of coconut milk

-   2 cups of chicken broth

-   6-8 leaves of Thai basil or regular basil or cilantro, chiffonade

-   1 tbsp. of sugar

-   2 tbsps. of fish sauce

## Directions

1. Turn the burner on medium heat. Once the pot is hot, add about 1 tbsp. of vegetable oil, then add the shallots. Fry the shallots for 2-3 minutes to soften them up.
2. Add 3 tbsps. of Aroy-D yellow curry paste and a couple of tbsps. of coconut milk. Mix well. Add a bit more of coconut milk if needed.
3. Once the coconut milk and curry is combined, add the chicken. Cook and mix for 3 minutes. Add the potatoes and the remaining coconut milk.
4. Add 1 cup of chicken broth. Make sure that the potatoes are covered by the liquid. If necessary, add another cup of chicken broth.
5. Cover and simmer. Turn the heat down to a medium low. Cook it for 15 minutes or until the potato is tender.
6. Add 1 tbsp. of sugar and 2 tbsps. of fish sauce. Stir. Adjust the flavor accordingly.
7. Turn the heat off. Transfer the chicken curry into a serving bowl. Sprinkle some basil as little or as much as you like. Serve.
