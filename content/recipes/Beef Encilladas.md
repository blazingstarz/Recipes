## Ingredients

Red Enchilada Sauce:

-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil

-   1 tablespoon cornstarch

-    4 tablespoons chili powder

-   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

-   1/2 teaspoon salt

-   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin

-   1/4 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano

-   2 cups vegetable broth

Ground Beef Filling:

-   1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef

-   1 white onion diced

-   1/2 teaspoon salt

-   1/4 teaspoon black pepper

-   8 ounces diced green chiles

Enchiladas:

-   12 corn tortillas

-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying

-   3 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

-   1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Directions

Make the enchilada sauce:

1. Heat vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in cornstarch, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, cumin, and oregano. Pour in vegetable broth and bring to a simmer until thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

Make the ground beef filling:

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add in ground beef and onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook until ground beef is browned and cooked through, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess fat. Stir in green chiles.

Assemble enchiladas:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a 9x13 pan with nonstick cooking spray. Spread 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Working one at a time, fry tortillas in oil until soft. DO NOT CRISP.
3. Dip each tortilla into the enchilada sauce to coat and set on a plate. Fill with a scoop of the ground beef filling and top with a generous pinch of cheese. Roll and place into the prepared 9x13 pan. Drizzle remaining sauce over enchiladas in the pan and top with remaining shredded cheese. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until cheese is warm and bubbly. Top with chopped cilantro and serve hot.
