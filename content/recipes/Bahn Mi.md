for the seasoning (choose one or more):

for the sandwich:

- 1 to 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped or hand-torn cilantro sprigs, mint leaves, or basil leaves

## Directions

1. Make the Viet pickle: Peel and cut the daikon into sticks about 3-4 inches long and the width of an average chopstick. Peel and cut the carrot into sticks a little skinnier than the daikon.
2. Put vegetables into a bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Massage until there's a little pool of water at the bottom of the bowl. Once you can bend a daikon stick tips touching without breaking, that's a sign that's it's good to go. 
3. Rinse vegetables with water and drain.
4. In a medium bowl, mix 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup water, and vinegar into a bowl. Whisk it together until it's clear and then pour it over to your vegetables in the bowl. Leave it in the bowl for 1 hour; otherwise, you can put it in a jar and you're going to add the brine and cap it, and then just put it in the fridge.
5. Prepare the char siu chicken: Do a little scoring on the chicken thighs and flatten the thighs out.
6. Marinate mixture: Mix a clove of garlic, finely minced, Chinese five-spice powder, ketchup, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, honey, and sesame oil in a bowl.
7. Add the chicken to the marinate mix. Make sure all pieces are coated.
8. Once you have all the chicken being coated, cover it with plastic wrap and sit it at room temperature for 30 minutes. You can also refrigerate it for 24 hours if you want to make the chicken ahead of time. Before you cook off the chicken, if you chilled it, make sure to return it to room temperature because then it'll cook a lot faster and easier.
9. Cooking char siu chicken: You have two ways to cook it. You can use an outdoor grill if you got access to one or you can use a stovetop grill.
10. Heat pan really, really hot.
11. When the pan is hot, put a little oil, brush it on. Lay your meat on.
12. When the chicken is cooked, cool it a little bit. Set aside.
13. Preparing the bread: Get your bread and put them on a small baking sheet and bake it on 325 F for about 3-6 minutes.
14. While the bread is in the oven, get your meat and thinly slice it across the grain.
15. Get your bread. When trying to cut your bread, try to keep a little hinge on the back of your bread.
16. Making the sandwich: Put some fat (in this case, mayonnaise) on your bread. Spread it side by side, all the way to the top edge. Put some Maggi seasoning sauce. Put some sliced chicken thighs on the sandwich. Put some pickle on top of the meat. Make sure the pickles are drained before putting it on the sandwich. Put some chilies and cucumber. Lastly, put some herb on top of the cucumber. Close the bread and you got Banh Mi sandwich.
