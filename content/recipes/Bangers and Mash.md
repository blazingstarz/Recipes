## Ingredients

-   2 potatoes, cubed

-   5 - 6 banger sausages

-   1 red onion, cut into slices (You can use the onion of your choice)

-   1 tbsp of butter

-   1 tbsp of olive oil

-   3 cloves of garlic, chopped

-   2 tbsp of milk

-   1 tsp of garlic powder

-   1/2 tsp of salt

-   1 tsp of pepper

-   1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce

-   1 1/2 cups of beef broth (I use a Knorr mix with water/beef cubes can also be used)

-   2 tbsp of all purpose flour

## Directions

1. Boil the potatoes for 10 to 15 minutes until fork tender.
2. While the potatoes are boiling, add the butter and olive oil to a pan over medium high heat. Place the sausage in and fry for about 4 minutes on each side until browned.
3. Set them aside on a plate.
4. In the same pan, add the onions in and fry until soft and just about caramelized. Add in the garlic and saute until fragrant. 
5. Add in the flour. Stir and cook for a minute or two.
6. Pour in half the broth and stir until combined. 
7. Add in the remaining broth, bring to a boil, and stir until it thickens. 
8. Put the Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in. Stir once again. 
9. Set aside for a few minutes.
10. Add the milk, butter, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the potatoes. Mash until smooth and creamy. You can put more milk in if necessary. 
11. Place the potatoes on a plate, put two of the bangers over the top, and spoon the onion gravy over.
12. Spoon some peas on the side, serve, and enjoy.
