Recipe adapted from Johanna Ware, Smallwares, Portland, OR

Yield: 12 to 14 buns
Prep Time: 20 minutes, plus proofing time
Cook Time: 8 minutes
Total Time: 28 minutes, plus proofing time

## Ingredients:

- ⅔ cup warm water
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1¼ cups bread flour, plus more for if needed
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda

## Directions:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the water, yeast and sugar until the yeast dissolves.
Let the mixture sit until the yeast starts to get foamy and bloom, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in
the oil and set aside.

2. Meanwhile, sift the bread flour, salt and baking soda together. Add the yeast
mixture to the dry ingredients and stir using a rubber spatula. If the dough looks
sticky, add 1 additional tablespoon of flour at a time until it is less sticky.

3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Cover
the dough with a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rest until it has doubled in
size, 1½ to 2 hours. Punch the dough down to flatten it.

4. Portion the dough into balls that are 2 inches in diameter and let rest for 5 minutes.
Flatten each ball into a disk 3 inches in diameter.

5. Fill the buns with your filling of choice and wrap by gathering the edge and twisting
slightly. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to keep the bao from drying out.
