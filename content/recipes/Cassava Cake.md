## Ingredients

-   1 kilo Fresh Cassava (around 4 cups)

-   1 cup coconut milk (250ml)

-   2 large eggs

-   1/4 cup melted butter (or margarine)

-   1 can evaporated milk (370ml)

-   1 can condensed milk (390g)

FOR TOPPINGS:

-   1/2 coconut milk

-   1 large eggs (or 2 egg yolks)

-   Grated cheese (optional)

-   1/2 cup condensed milk

## Directions

1. If you are using fresh cassava, peel and remove the root part in the middle. Wash then grate using fine grater (for smoother texture). Using a fine sieve, squeeze some of the excess juice. Do not squeeze too hard. Just enough to remove excess juice.
2. Preheat oven at 175 C or 350 F.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine grated cassava, coconut milk, eggs, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and melted butter. Mix until well-combined.
4. Grease the baking pan with softened butter/margarine or oil. Then, pour some mixture on it. Cooking time depends on the thickness. This recipe is around 1 inch thick.
5. Bake for around 45 to 60 minutes at 175 C.
6. Meanwhile, make the toppings. Combine the coconut milk, condensed milk and egg. Mix until well-blended. Set aside.
7. After 50 minutes, get the cassava cake from the oven. Pour the toppings on the top of the baked cassava. Sprinkle with grated cheese. NOTE: Make sure that the cassava is firm and cooked before putting the topping.
8. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes or Broil for 10 minutes until the top is light brown and bubbly.
