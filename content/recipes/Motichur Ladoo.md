## Ingredients

For batter:

-   100 grams gram flour

-   150 mL water

For sugar syrup

-   a pinch of orange food color

-   1/2 cup water

-   3/4 cup sugar

Final cooking & shaping

-   1 tbsp of hot water

-   1 tbsp melted ghee

-   2 tsp melon seeds

## Directions

1. Place a sieve over a bowl & sieve in the gram flour. Further, add water in batches while whisking it continuously to make a lump free, thin & smooth batter.
2. Once the batter is ready, pour it into a piping bag & tie a knot to the open end of it.
3. Now, to fry the moti/small pearls, heat oil to 170 C or until moderately hot.
4. Once the oil is moderately hot, cut the tip of the piping bag to make a very fine hole then hold the piping bag over to kadhai & squeeze it gently. This will produce a stream of small droplets that will fall directly into the hot oil.
5. Fry the pearls medium flame until light golden brown, make sure you donâ€™t fry them too much.
6. Once fried, transfer the motis into a sieve using a ladle & gently give a jerk to the sieve to remove any excess oil.
7. Further, transfer the fried motis from the sieve into a tissue paper lined bowl & fry all the motis similarly & let them cool down completely. Your motis / pearls for motichoor laddu are ready.

For sugar syrup:

1. Add the food coloring & water into a bowl & stir well to dissolve.
2. Take a pan & add the sugar into it along with the prepared coloured water & switch on the flame to high. Stir well & cook until the sugar dissolves.
3. Once the sugar dissolves completely, switch off the flame & add all the fried motis into the pan & mix it well with sugar syrup.
4. When all the motis get combined with the sugar syrup, switch on the gas flame & cook the mixture over low flame until all the sugar syrup is absorbed by the motis. Add in a tablespoon of hot water if you feel like the mixture is getting dry.
5. Once all the sugar syrup is absorbed, switch off the flame, cover the pan & let the mixture rest for 10 minutes.
6. After the mixture has rested, transfer it into a large bowl & add ghee along with the melon seeds & mix gently. Let the mixture cooldown until it reaches room temperature.

Shaping the laddus:

1. Take a spoonful of the mixture & form it into balls using your hands. Shape all the remaining mixture similarly.
2. Your motichoor laddus are ready, garnish them with varak & chopped pistachio.
