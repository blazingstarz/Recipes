## Directions

Preparation:

2. Cover the bowl and keep it in the refrigerator for around 1 hour.

2nd Marination:

1. To make the 2nd marinade, take another bowl and add all the ingredients as shown in the video. Whisk it well to make a uniform and smooth marinade.
2. Now add the marinated chicken legs to the 2nd marinade and mix it well, making sure the marinade coats the chicken completely and massaged well inside the slits made earlier.
3. Now, cover the bowl and keep in the refrigerator for minimum 3 hrs or overnight. 

Process:

1. Preheat the oven/OTG to 250 degrees C.
2. Arrange the marinated chicken legs on a metal rack.
3. Slide in the rack/tray in the top slot of the oven.
4. Roast for 10 mins at 250 degrees C. After 10 mins, flip the chicken.
5. Roast for another 10 mins at 250 degrees C on the other side.
6. Flip the chicken legs and baste with melted butter.
7. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees C.
8. Roast for total of another 20 mins at 200 degrees C. Flip the chicken after 10 mins and continue basting with melted butter.
