Foccacia bread is amazing with soups, as a side dish or appetizer, but my favourite thing about it is that it's so,so delicious just on it's own. And this recipe is really quick and easy and ready in just 60 minutes! Try it and you'll love the infinite flavor possiblilties of this foccacia bread! 

## Ingredients: 
- 1 ¾ Cup AP Flour (215 grams)
- ½ tsp Sugar (2 grams) 
- ½ tsp Salt (3 grams) 
- 1 ½ tsp Quick-Rise Instant Yeast (4.7 grams) 
- ¾ Cup Lukewarm Water (177 grams) 
- 4 Tbsp Olive Oil (54 grams) - divided
- 1 ½ Tbsp Grated Parmesan (8.5 grams) 
- 1 tsp Garlic Powder (3.28 grams) or 1-2 fresh garlic cloves, minced 
- 1 Tbsp Fresh Rosemary (1.70 grams) or 1 tsp Dry Rosemary or Italian Seasoning (1 grams)  

Any additional toppings, such as cherry tomatoes, caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes, fresh basil, coarse sea salt, additional olive oil. 

## Preparation:

Preheat your oven to 200 °F (94 °C). 
Place 1 tbsp of olive oil into a 10’’ iron skillet or any tray or dish that is 10-12” in diameter. Spread the oil with a pastry brush to cover the bottom of the pan and set aside. 

Into a medium (or mixer) bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Mix to combine. Warm up the water to 90-100 F (32-38 C). If you don’t have a thermometer, test the water with your finger. If it feels warm, but you can still keep the finger in, it’s ready. If it’s too hot for the skin, cool down the water. I usually place a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup in the microwave for 15 seconds to get it to perfect temperature. 

Slowly pour the ¾ Cup of warm water and mix to combine with a dough hook attachment or a wooden spoon if you are making this bread by hand. The dough will be dry and rough with a consistency of “shaggy dough”. Now add 1 Tbsp of olive oil and mix to combine. Let it knead with a dough hook attachment for a few minutes, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If making by hand, transfer onto a counter and knead it for 5-8 minutes, until it forms a ball and becomes more elastic. 

Now transfer the dough into the pan and stretch it out to fit the full size of the pan. The dough will be stretching back as you press, but just keep going and it will spread. 

Turn off the oven. Place a clean cloth over the dough and place the dough in the warm oven for 20 minutes to proof. 

While the dough is proofing, prepare your toppings. 
In a small bowl, combine 1-2 Tbsp of olive oil with 1 ½ Tbsp of grated parmesan, 1 tsp of garlic powder or 2 fresh minced cloves, and 1 Tbsp of freshly chopped rosemary * 

After 20 minutes of proofing, take the bread out of the oven and now preheat your oven to 400 °F (200 °C).

Spread the olive oil, garlic-rosemary mixture over the surface of the bread and make indents with the tips of your fingers, so that the olive oil and toppings fit better. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Once baked, you can top the focaccia with more olive oil or some fresh chopped basil and coarse sea salt. Let it cool slightly, cut into slices and serve! 

Thank you for watching 😊 

Enjoy! 

*Fresh rosemary must be washed and patted dry with a paper towel. To remove the leaves, place your index finger and thumb at the tip of the stalk as squeeze these two fingers tightly around the stalk. While keeping the stalk firmly with the other hand, slide your fingertips down the stalk and the rosemary leaves will release from the stalk. Discard the stalk and then finely chop the leaves using a sharp knife or kitchen scissors. If you crush the leaves slightly afterwards, you will be able to release more flavor.
