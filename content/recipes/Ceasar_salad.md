-   2 egg yolks
    
-   Juice of 1.5 large lemons
    
-   1 heaping Tbsp (18g) dijon
    
-   1.25 cup 300ml vegetable oil
    
-   3/4 cup grated parmigiano
    
-   Pepper to taste
    
-   Garlic bread Croutons
    
-   Leaves
    

  

## INSTRUCTIONS:

**Method:**

1.  Start by smashing the garlic cloves, sprinkle with kosher salt, and finely chop using the rolling chop method. Chop, gather, chop, gather, and occasionally smear with a knife. Continue this process for 3-5 minutes.
    
2.  Finely chop anchovy filets until fine as possible.
    
3.  Mix garlic and anchovy paste together until fully combined.
    
4.  To a medium size bowl, add in garlic paste, egg yolks, lemon juice, and dijon mustard. Season to taste with salt and whisk together.
    
5.  While constantly whisking, slowly add vegetable oil until fully emulsified then grate in parmigiano reggiano and whisk to combine.
    
6.  For croutons, slice a loaf of ciabatta in half and into individual slices. Cover with garlic butter, place on a baking sheet lined with foil and set in a 400F oven for 10 minutes. Cut bread into crouton size before adding to salad.
    
7.  Toss all the salad leaves together in a large bowl before serving in a bowl topped with croutons and dressing.
    
8.  To properly dress the salad, place greens in a large bowl and season with salt. Add desired dressing to the side of the bowl then using tongs toss the salad to coat evenly with dressing.
    
9.  Plate and top with croutons and an optional parmesan.
