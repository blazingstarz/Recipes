## Ingredients

-   200grams cornstarch

-   3 cups coconut milk 

-   1 big can evaporated milk (370 ml)

-   1 big can condensed milk (300 ml)

-   1 can Cream style corn

-   1 1/2 cup sugar (adjust if needed)

-   2 cups water + 1 cup to dissolve cornstarch (3 cups total)

-   cheese for toppings

## Directions

1. In a pot, mix everything except corn starch and reserve 1 cup of water.
2. Mix well until sugar dissolves. Taste the mixture and see if the sweetness is per your liking. Add or reduce sugar as needed.
3. Turn on the heat and let it boil in medium heat.
4. Meanwhile, in a bowl, dissolve cornstarch with the water you reserved (1 cup). Make sure that thereâ€™s no lumps. Set aside.
5. Once the mixture is boiling, add in the cornstarch while whisking continuously and vigorously. Cook for at least 5 minutes while whisking in between to avoid burning and sticking in the bottom.
6. Once cooked, transfer to a tray or dish. Set it aside and let it cool.
