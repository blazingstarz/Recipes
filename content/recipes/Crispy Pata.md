## Ingredients

-   1 whole pork leg

-   1 cup vinegar

-   1 can (12 ounces) 7-up or Sprite

-   1 head garlic, peeled and minced

-   1 tablespoon peppercorns

-   3 bay leaves

-   salt

-   5 cups oil

For the Dipping Sauce:

-   1 cup vinegar

-   1/4 soy sauce

-   2 shallots, peeled and chopped

-   2 Thai chili peppers, peeled and minced

-   salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. With a knife, scrape any stray hairs on pork leg and trim off nails.
2. In a large pot over medium heat, combine pork leg, vinegar, 7-up, 6 cups of the water, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, and 1/3 cup salt. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that may accumulate on top.
3. Lower heat, cover, and then simmer for about 11/2 to 2 hours or until meat is tender but not falling apart. If the meat is drying before it is fully cooked, add more water in 1 cup increments.
4. Drain pork leg, discarding liquid and aromatics. Place on a rack and allow to cool to touch.
5. Sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons salt and massage all over. Place in a container with a lid and freeze overnight.
6. In a large pot over medium heat, heat about 4 to 5 cups of oil (enough to cover the pork leg during deep-frying) to 350 F.
7. Gently add pork leg and deep-fry, turning as needed, until golden. 
8. Remove pork from the pot and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Let rest for about 3 to 5 minutes before chopping. Serve hot with dipping sauce.

Dipping Sauce:

1. In a small bowl, combine vinegar, soy sauce, shallots, garlic, chili peppers, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir well.
