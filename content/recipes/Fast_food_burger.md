## Ingredients:

-   Ground Beef (80/20)
-   Salt
-   Pepper
-   Avocado Oil
-   Lettuce
-   Tomato
-   Hamburger Buns
-   Ketchup
-   Mustard
-   Frank's red hot sauce
-   American Cheese

## Instructions:

1.  Preheat your grill or stovetop grill pan to medium-high heat. You want it nice and hot so the burgers get a good sear.
    
2.  Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape into patties. Sprinkle each patty with a little bit of salt and pepper on both sides.
    
3.  Coat the grill or grill pan with a thin layer of cooking oil. Place the patties on the grill and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until they are cooked to your desired level of doneness.
    
4.  During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of American cheese on top of each patty, if desired. This will make the burgers extra gooey and delicious!
    
5.  Assemble the burgers by placing a patty on the bottom bun, followed by lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, and Frank's Red Hot sauce (if using). Top with the top bun.
    
6.  Wrap each burger in foil to keep it warm and to help the bun stay moist. You won't need to go to fast food if you do this step!
    
7.  Serve the burgers hot, with your choice of side dishes. Enjoy!
