-   1.5 lbs stewing beef

-   2 Tbsp tomato paste

-   1 tsp caraway seeds

-   1/2 tsp lemon zest

-   2 Tbsp sweet paprika

-   1/2 cup red wine

-   1.5 cups beef broth

## Directions

1. Peel and finely chop onion and garlic. Destem and deseed chili and chop finely as well.
2. Preheat a large braiser over medium heat. Add bacon fat or oil to a large braiser and brown beef in batches. For a nice sear working in batches is essential. Sear on all sides until dark brown. Then set aside.
3. Add chopped onions, garlic, and chili to the braiser and stir-fry until brown. Then add tomato paste, caraway seeds, lemon zest and paprika, give a quick stir and then immediately add red wine to deglaze the bottom.
4. Add beef broth and return the browned beef to the braiser. Make sure all beef is submerged in the broth. Reduce heat to low, cover the braiser and let the meat simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
5. In the meantime, deseed peppers and cut them into bite-size pieces. After the 1:15 hours simmering time add the peppers to the beef, give it a quick stir then put the lid back on and let simmer for another 45 minutes.
6. Serve over egg noodles or German Spaetzle, sprinkle with fresh parsley and enjoy!
