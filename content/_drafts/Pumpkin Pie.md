## Ingredients

-   1 (9-inch) homemade pie crust or store-bought*

-   3/4 cup packed light brown sugar (165g)

-   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

-   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

-   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

-   1/8 teaspoon cloves

-   1/2 teaspoon salt

-   1 (15-ounce/425g) can pumpkin puree

-   1 (12-ounce/354ml) can evaporated milk

-   3 large eggs room temperature

## Directions

1. If using a homemade pie crust or sheets of store-bought crust, line a 9-inch pie dish with dough and crimp edges. Chill the crust until ready to use (see notes about blind baking).
2.  Preheat the oven to 400F.
3.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, spices, and salt. Add the pumpkin, milk, and eggs, and whisk until well combined. Pour into the pie shell. (You can brush the edges of the pie crust with an egg wash, if desired.)
4. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350F. Continue baking until the filling is puffed and jiggles slightly in the center when gently shaken, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack. If making ahead, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days before serving.

Note: *If using homemade pie dough, it's recommended to blind-bake the crust for a crisp and flaky shell. To blind bake, roll a disk of homemade dough into a 14-inch circle, line a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan, crimp the edges and freeze the crust for 20 minutes. Line with parchment paper and fill with weights. Bake for 15 minutes at 425F. Remove parchment and weights and let cool before proceeding with the filling. Store-bought crusts like preshaped frozen pie shells or Pillsbury pie crust sheets do not need to be blind-baked.
