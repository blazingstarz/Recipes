## Ingredients

-   1 tbsp. peanut or vegetable oil

-   1/2 tsp. sesame oil

-   1 large egg

-   1/3 cup frozen peas and carrots

-   2 tbsp. chopped onion

-   1/2 pound 41-50 shrimp, peeled, deveined and thawed

-   3 cups cooked rice

-   1/2 tsp. salt

-   1/4 tsp. sugar

-   1 tbsp. lite soy sauce

-   1/2 tsp. mushroom flavored dark soy sauce

## Directions

1. Pre-heat pan on medium heat. Get your egg ready. Put it on a small bowl, whisk it.
2. Add 1 tbsp. or so of peanut oil or vegetable oil on your pan. Add 1/2 tsp. of sesame oil. Swirl the oil around the bottom of your pan. Make sure you have enough oil in your pan so that nothing sticks. Make sure it is completely covered.
3. Before trying to fry anything, make sure to test the oil if it's already hot. 
4. Add the egg into the pan. By using a spatula, move it around like you're making scrambled eggs. Make it in sheet form as much as possible. Once it starts to get solidified, go ahead and flip it over. Move it off to the side of the pan.
5. Put 1/3 cup of peas and carrots on the pan. If you get the peas and carrots from the freezer, you don't have to defrost them or anything. Add 2 tbsps. of chopped onions. Stir fry the ingredients, except the egg, for 1 minute or so.
6. Add the shrimps. Stir fry for 1 minute or so. Make sure you don't overcooked the shrimps. When they get pink a little bit on the outside, go ahead and push them off to the side.
7. Break up the egg into pieces.
8. Mix the ingredients together. Make sure the shrimps are fully cooked before you add the rice.
9. Add cooked rice in the pan. Make sure you use cold rice. If you start out with room-temperature rice or warm rice, it's just going to turn the mush. Break up rice clumps if there's any.
10. Add 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 of 1 tsp. of sugar as well as 1 tbsp. of light soy sauce. 
11. Add also 1/2 tsp. of mushroom flavored dark soy sauce. You can get this from an Asian market or Amazon. This will add color to the fried rice and also adds tons of flavor.
12. Stir fry the rice a little bit for a minute or so. Make sure your soy sauce, salt, and sugar gets all incorporated. Break up rice clumps if there's any. Make sure the shrimps are cooked all the way through.
13. Serve.
