## Ingredients

Dough

-   2 large egg + 3 large yolk + enough cold water to get 185g of wet ingredients

-   300g bread flour (unbleached all-purpose is fine in a pinch)

-   5.7g salt (1 tsp table salt or 2 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher or weighed for all other salt types)

Filling

-   1 Lb Swiss Chard

-   2 Tbsp olive oil

-   1 garlic clove, sliced

-   1 Lb Whole Milk Ricotta without gums or stabilizers

-   10g finely grated parmesan 

-   Salt, pepper, and acidity to taste (I use pomegranate molasses or lemon juice)

Sage butter sauce:

-   4 Tbsp unsalted butter

-   1 whole garlic clove

-   10-12 sage leaves

-   Salt and lemon juice to taste

## Directions

For dough

1. Put the wet ingredients into a bowl of a mixer. Add the salt and flour and mix with a dough hook on medium-low until homogeneous. 
2. Touch the dough, if it’s at all sticky, add more flour. Knead for 5 more minutes in a mixer (assuming it’s doing a good job with this stiff dough) or 8 minutes by hand. 
3. Flour, wrap in plastic, and let rest 30 min and up to 5 hours at room temperature.

For filling

1. Cut the chard stems into small pieces. Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. 
2. When the oil is hot, add the chard stems and a pinch of salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally until brown and tender, about 10 min.  
3. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about a minute. 
4. Slice the chard leaves, chop into small pieces, and add to the pan. 
5. Cover and cook until starting to wilt, 2-3 minutes. 
6. Uncover, and cook stirring until completely wilted. 
7. Take off heat, and season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice or pomegranate molasses.  Cool completely. 
8. Drain ricotta for 15 min between 6 layers of paper towels (3 on top and 3 on the bottom), pressed with a heavy pot. 
9. Combine the chard, ricotta, and parmesan. Mix well and adjust the seasoning.
10. Roll out the dough and fill in. You’ll need rice flour and a ravioli tray or or a ravioli stamp. You can also cut the ravioli with a pastry scraper, pastry wheel, or a knife.

For sage butter sauce

1. Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and whisk until it melts and the white foam subsides. Add the garlic and sage. Cook until the sage leaves start to stiffen.  Flip and cook until the leaves are crisp and the butter is brown. Sprinkle the leaves with a little salt. Cook for 5 minutes. Remove the garlic clove and discard. Season with a few drops of lemon juice and salt.
2. Bring a large pot of water to almost a boil. Salt heavily.  (I use 65g salt for 6.5qt (6 L) of water). Bring to a boil. Add the ravioli. Cover just until the water boils. Uncover, reduce heat to maintain an energetic simmer, and cook until done, about 1 min for fresh, 2-3 for frozen.  
3. Mix with sage butter and an additional 4 Tbsp of fresh butter and serve immediately.
