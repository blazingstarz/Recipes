## Ingredients

-   2 cups all purpose flour (Or whole wheat flour)

-   2 tbsp vegetable oil

-   2 tsp salt

-   3/4 cup of water

-   Butter or ghee (optional)

## Directions

1. Place the flour into a mixing bowl along with the salt. Mix dry ingredients and add the oil and one third of the water. Mix well using the tips of your fingers, add another third of water and keep mixing until you have a granular texture. Add the remainder of the flour and start to knead the dough for approx five minutes. Cover with cling film and leave aside.
2. On your work bench, dust with flour place the dough and shape it into a fat sausage shape. Tear off 1/5 of the dough and roll into a ball. Repeat process until you have five balls of equal sizes. Place aside covered.
3. Flour your bench, place one ball on it, and dust the top with more flour. Flatten using your hands and then roll it thin into an even disc shape using a rolling pin. They should be approx 6 inches in diameter and a little thinner than a coin. 
4. Heat up a dry pan on high heat. Once quite hot, add the flattened dough and watch it bubble up in approx 30 to 50 seconds. Flip over when the underneath has a light brown spots (not too dark). You donâ€™t want to cook that side too much. Remove pan from heat and turn up heat to full. Using a spatula or egg flipper, remove the bread from pan, flip it and place it directly onto the naked flame until puffed. Remove immediately or it will burn.
5. You can brush butter or ghee over the bread or on the edges to stop them drying out.
