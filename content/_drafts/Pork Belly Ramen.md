For Aji-Tama Soft Boiled Eggs:

- 	4 tbsp. water

- 	1 tbsp. mirin 

- 	1 tsp. cooking sake

## Directions

For Chashu:

1. Take one block of pork belly around 3cm (leave to reach room temperature for one hour before preparing) 
2. Wipe off any moisture from the pork before tying around the block with kitchen twine. Knot the twine firmly, then do the same for the length of the pork (this will help the pork stay moist and help it keep its shape).
3. In a ziplock bag, add  1 tbsp. soy sauce, 1 tbsp. mirin, ½ tbsp. cooking sake, 1 tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. salt, 1 clove garlic, and the same amount of ginger (around 5g).
4. Mix those ingredients together in the bag and then add the pork. Make sure to take out any air from the bag 
5. Either use a low temperature cooker or a saucepan with a cooking thermometer and keep your water at around 63°C (145°F), place the ziplock bag in the water and leave cooking for 80 mins.

For broth:

1. Let the ingredients for the ramen broth soak in water. Take 10g of dried kombu kelp and 20g of niboshi sardines and let soak in 1L of water for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

For aji-tama eggs:

1. Prepare the aji-tama soft boiled eggs (1 egg per serving). To make the eggs easier to peel, place a small hole in the round side of the egg before adding to boiling water for 6 minutes. 
2. Once 6 minutes is up, take the eggs out and add immediately to cold water under a running tap for 1 minute 
3. Peel the eggs. In a ziplock bag, add 7 tbsp. soy sauce, 4 tbsp. water, 1 tbsp. mirin, 1 tsp. cooking sake and 1 tsp sugar - mix the ingredients well and add the eggs - let sit for at least 30 minutes.

For broth:

1. Take the soaked ingredients from before and run the liquid through a sieve into a saucepan or stock-pot.
2. Then add 450g of chicken mince (or chicken stock) and break apart with a spatula 
3. Turn up to a medium heat and keep stirring to avoid the chicken clumping at the bottom of the pan.
4. Add the niboshi sardines and kombu back from before.
5. Keep stirring until you see the broth reach about 60°C (140°C) and the protein starts to float to the top of the liquid.
6. Before the broth begins to boil, take out the kombu to avoid your soup becoming bitter
7. Put a lid on the broth and let simmer for 30 mins (check occasionally and get rid of any foam that surfaces on the top to improve the flavour)
8. Once 30 minutes is done - drain the ramen and remove all the solid ingredients, and your broth is done!

For the ramen (finishing the toppings):

1. Take 1/4 green onion and cut a slice down the outer layer. Cut that into thin strips and let it soak in water for a few minutes.
2. For the inner layer, chop it into small chunks. This will be a topping for your ramen 
3. Once 80 mins is done for your chashu pork, braize the outside fatty layer with a cooking blow-torch, oven, or fry pan.
4. Cut your pork into small medallions to add as a topping.
5. Cut your aji-tama eggs in half. If they’re cooked right, they should still be slightly runny inside.
6. Boil the noodles (either fresh or dried) for the time specified on the packaging. Whilst the noodles are boiling, heat up your broth from before and also warm your ramen bowl with hot water.
7. When the noodles are done cooking, throw away the water, add 360ml of your ramen broth to a bowl, add 1 tsp of salt and mix
8. Drain the noodles. Add them to the broth, top with onions, chashu pork and aji-tama and enjoy your perfect ramen.
