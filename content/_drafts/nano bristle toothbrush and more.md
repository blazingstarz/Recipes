For over a quarter century, I've been brushing my teeth with all kinds of toothbrushes. I've tried your standard brands like Colgate, Braun, Crest and even the boutique brands you find at Wholefoods or natural health stores. I've even been a been a long time user of the Sonicare and Oral B brush systems. But then I discovered the brush that changed everything in 2022--the nano bristle brush that has 20,000 ultra soft nano strands that can really give you that squeaky clean smile.

The nano brush is different from all the others I've tried. It has 20,000 ultra-soft nano strands that can really give you that squeaky clean feeling after brushing. The brush is so soft that it won't damage your enamel like hard bristles can. And because of the density of the bristles, these brushes can clear the toughest debris and biofilms in your mouth with ease. In fact, I noticed how effective the brush was at cleaning my teeth that I decided to try it as a spot cleaner for delicate materials and fabrics.

The second major component of my dental hygiene routine is flossing. I used to use traditional floss, but I've found that my favorite is the dual strand disposable floss picks. These picks are definitely more effective at pulling out any salad or food particles stuck in the teeth. I even carry a pack in my car just in case I eat out. 

At home, I also use a water pick. These give the mouth a great feeling and can help flush out anything that the floss picks and brushing will miss. The water pick is a powerful device that uses a stream of water to clean between your teeth, reaching places that traditional flossing cannot. It is also great for people who have difficulty using traditional floss, such as those with arthritis or mobility issues.

Another important aspect of my oral hygiene routine is using a tongue scraper. A tongue scraper is a small tool that is used to scrape the surface of the tongue, removing bacteria and other debris that can cause bad breath. The benefits of using a tongue scraper are many. It can help to remove bacteria that can cause bad breath, reduce the risk of tooth decay and gum disease, and even improve the sense of taste. Plus, it is a quick and easy addition to my morning routine.

Anyone serious about maintaining fresh breath needs to have a good mouthwash that's used throughout the day. My favorite ones leave the mouth refreshed and nourished. I tend to go with one that has auruvedic botanicals like neem and aloe. Neem has been used for medicinal purposes by Indians for many millennia and has quickly gained popularity in the western world. Neem is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. It can help to reduce plaque and prevent tooth decay. Aloe, on the other hand, is known for its soothing properties and can help to reduce inflammation in the gums.

One of the main ingredients I look for in my dental hygiene products is neem. Are you even a natural toothpaste brand if you don't have neem in your ingredients? Actually, as an Indian, neem occasionally finds its way into my diet. It's definitely an acquired tastes. Newcomers take care when trying it... Actually, one of my grandfather's uncles used to have the brightest and whitest teeth in his village in India and it was because he regularly chewed on neem leaves and twigs. He claimed that it helped to keep his teeth and gums healthy, and it all makes sense now. 

In addition to my daily oral hygiene routine, I also make sure to see my dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings. And I make sure to practice good oral hygiene habits, such as not smoking, limiting sugary and acidic foods, and avoiding alcohol.

Overall, maintaining a consistent oral hygiene routine and using the right products can make all the difference in achieving and maintaining a healthy mouth. The nano bristle brush, floss picks, water pick, tongue scraper, and mouthwash with auruvedic botanicals have all been game changers for me, and I highly recommend giving them a try. And remember, a healthy mouth leads to a healthy body, so don't neglect your oral hygiene.
