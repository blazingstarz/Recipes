## Ingredients

Ingredients:

-	1 lb Large Shrimp (21-25 count), peeled and deveined (keep the shells)

-	3 oz Vermicelli Rice Noodles

-	1/2 butter lettuce (15 leaves)

-	2 carrots, peeled and julienned

-	1/2 English cucumber julienned (or 3 small cucumbers)

-	1 cup Cilantro sprigs

-	15 round rice paper sheets (8.5‚Äù diameter)

## Directions

1. Put the shells in a medium saucepan along with 1 tbsp. of garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. of black pepper, and a bay leaf. Add 8 cups of cold water and bring that to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Once it boils, add all of the shrimp at once. Simmer it until they're pink. It takes 2-3 minutes depending on the size of the shrimp.
3. As soon as the shrimps are cooked, immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water. Set aside to cool.
4. Preparing the noodles: Fill a saucepan with water, bring it to a boil, then add the noodles. Turn off the heat and let it sit in hot water for about 5-7 minutes or until they're softened.
5. Once the noodles are done, drain them in a colander and rinse with cold water. Set them aside and just let them drain well.
6. Cut the shrimp in 1/2 lengthwise.
7. Preparing the vegetables: Get your cucumber and slice it into thin slices. Keep the cucumber skins on for a little extra crunch. Next, peel 2 carrots. Julianne them or grate. Set aside.
8. Get your lettuce. If you have larger leaves, you can cut them into two. Just make sure to remove the thick stem in the center. Finally, get your coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro. Set aside.
9. To assemble, hydrate the rice paper sheets. Fill a round dish like a pie pan with very warm water. Make sure that your pan is wide enough to hold an 8 1/2 inch diameter of rice paper.
10. Working with one sheet at a time, submerge the sheet in warm water for 10-15 seconds or until it feels soft and flimsy. Please don't oversoak. The timing will depend on the temperature of the water. If your water is warmer, it will soften faster.
11. Place your wet spring roll wrapper over a lightly-wet cutting board. Add a lettuce leaf in the bottom half of the spring roll wrapper, then add a generous pinch of rice noodles. Top that with some cucumber slices, your julienned carrots, some sprigs of cilantro, and add the shrimp. Place three halves of shrimp with the cut side up on the top half of the wrapper. Make sure it's visible when the spring roll is wrapped up.
12. Keep a tight roll. Start wrapping from the bottom, then fold in the sides over the shrimp and finish rolling the spring roll.
13. Transfer your finished rolls to a serving platter. It's super important to keep those covered as you're rolling them so that those rice paper wrappers don't dry out.
14. To serve, cut the spring rolls in half on the diagonal.
