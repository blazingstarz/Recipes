## Ingredients

-   4 boneless pork or veal chops

-   1 teaspoon salt

-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper

-   1 cup all-purpose flour

-   2 large eggs

-   1 tablespoon lemon juice

-   1 cup plain bread crumbs

-   Vegetable oil for frying

## Directions

1. Trim meat of any unwanted fat (if desired). Lay the pork or veal chops out on a countertop between two layers of plastic wrap. Pound out chops until 1/4 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Spread flour out into a shallow dish. In another shallow dish, whisk eggs together with lemon juice. In a third shallow dish, spread out bread crumbs.
3. Pour about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil into a large deep skillet. Bring oil to 350 degrees F.
4. Dredge chops into flour to coat, then immediately dip into eggs to coat, followed by bread crumbs to coat.
5. Place chops into the hot oil and fry 3 to 4 minutes. Work in batches if needed based on size of pan. Chops shouldn't be crowded.
6. Gently flip over and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes on the other side until chop reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 F and is browned and crisp.
7. Serve hot with lemon slices.
