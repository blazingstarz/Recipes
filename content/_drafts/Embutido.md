## Ingredients

-   3 lbs ground pork

-   1 large yellow onion minced

-   1 large red bell pepper minced

-   1 large carrot minced

-   3/4 to 1 cup sweet pickle relish

-   2 to 4 oz. raisins

-   1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese

-   3 eggs

-   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

-   1 teaspoon salt

-   2 cups breadcrumbs

-   4 to 5 cups water for steaming

## Directions

1. Prepare the embutido meatloaf by combining the following ingredients in a large mixing bowl: ground pork, onion, red bell pepper, carrot, sweet relish, raisins, cheese, eggs, salt, and ground black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are blended.
2. Add the bread crumbs. Continue to mix until well blended.
3. Scoop a cup of embutido mixture and place over a sheet of pre-cut aluminum foil (12 x 10 inches). Mold the mixture to form a cylindrical shape. Roll the foil and secure both edges. Set aside. Do this until all the embutido meatloaf mixture is consumed.
4. Arrange the wrapped embutido in a steamer. Pour water on the steamer and let boil. Steam (in medium heat) for 60 minutes.
5. Remove the steamed pork embutido from the steamer. Let it cool down. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Slice and arrange in a serving plate. You can also fry it.
6. Serve. Share and enjoy!
