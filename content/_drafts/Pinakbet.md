## Ingredients

-   1 bunch string beans (cut into 2 inches)

-   2 – 3 cups squash

-   1 small bitter gourd

-   2 pieces eggplant (sliced)

-   3 – 5 pieces okra (sliced)

-   250 grams pork belly

-   1/4 cup fresh shrimp paste

-   1 medium-sized onion (chopped)

-   4 cloves of garlic (minced)

## Directions

1. Season the pork belly with salt and then massage the meat. Let it sit for 5 minutes.

3. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. Reduce the oil from the pan.
4. Sauté the eggplants for a few minutes until light brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. Sauté the onions, garlic and ginger for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes and continue sautéing. Gently press to crush them. Lastly, add the fresh shrimp paste and sauté for a few minutes.

7. Add the bitter gourd and okra. Toss to combine well. Cover the pan again and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until the new veggies are tender.
8. Add the seared pork belly and stir well. Season with black pepper. Add the eggplant and toss to combine well.
