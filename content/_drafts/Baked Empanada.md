-   3/4 cup diced yellow onion (93g)

-   1/3 cup diced carrot (45g)

-   1/3 cup diced celery (45g)

-   3 garlic cloves minced

-   1 tablespoon tomato paste

-   1 teaspoon chili powder

-   1 teaspoon ground cumin

-   1 teaspoon salt

-   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

-   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

-   1/2 cup frozen peas (76g)

Dough:

-   3 cups all-purpose flour (360g)

-   1/2  teaspoon salt

-   3/4 cup cold unsalted butter cut into small pieces (170g)

-   1 large egg

-   1/3 cup water (80mL)

Assembly:

-   1 large egg

-   water if needed

## Directions

For the Filling:

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the beef, onion, carrot, and celery. Cook until the beef is browned and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, salt, cinnamon, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the peas and cook for an additional 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool while making the dough.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

For the Dough:

1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt; pulse 3 times. Add butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Add the egg and the water; pulse until a dough forms a ball around the side of the bowl. Transfer to a clean work surface and knead a few times just until the dough forms a smooth ball. Divide the dough in half.

For the Assembly:

1. Working with one half at a time, roll out dough to a 1/16-inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface. Using a 6-inch round cutter, cut out 6 circles. (You can also a round container as a guide and run a sharp knife around it to cut the dough.) Reroll dough as needed. Repeat with the remaining half of the dough.
2. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of filling in the middle of each dough circle. Fold circles in half and press the edges together. (If the dough doesn’t want to stick together, rub a little bit of water on the edge of the dough before closing.) Crimp the dough with your fingers or a fork all around the edge to seal. Place empanadas on the lined baking sheet.
3. In a small bowl, beat 1 egg. Brush empanadas with the egg wash.
4. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes before serving. Refrigerate any leftover in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.
