## Ingredients

-   2 cups cooked basmati rice (day-old is best)

-   1 tsp garam masala

-   1/2 tsp ground turmeric

-   1/2 tsp kashmiri chilli powder

-   2 tbsp coriander (cilantro) leaves, finely chopped

-   1 tsp sea salt flakes

-   2 tbsp vegetable oil or ghee

-   1 medium-sized potato, peeled, diced

-   1 small brown onion, diced

-   3 garlic cloves, finely diced

-   2 tbsp roasted whole peanuts

-   4-5 curry leaves

-   2 dried red chillies, small

-   1/2 tsp mustard seeds

-   1/2 tsp cumin seeds

## Directions

1. Place rice in a large bowl, then follow with the garam masala, turmeric, kashmiri chilli and coriander in a large bowl. Add in salt, then give everything a good mix to ensure that every grain of rice is coated in spice. Leave aside for 15 minutes to allow flavours to infuse.
2. Preheat wok on high heat with 1 tablespoon of ghee. Using a spatula, fry potatoes for 5 minutes until they are cooked through and lightly golden brown. Add in onion, then continue cooking for another 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add in garlic, peanuts, curry leaves, dried chilli, constantly moving ingredients around in the pan. Follow with mustard seeds and cumin seeds.
3. Add another tablespoon of ghee if needed and increase heat back to medium-high heat. Next, add the flavoured rice to the wok. Continue tossing all ingredients together in the pan until everything is incorporated. Serve and enjoy!
