      <description>Welcome, friends and new visitors, to my cooking blog! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you&amp;rsquo;re here.
This website is a collection of recipes that I have personally tried and enjoyed, found on Youtube and the internet. I love to cook and eat a wide variety of cuisines, from American to Indian and everything in between. Some of my all-time favorite recipes that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across include:
Baked Salmon: This simple yet delicious recipe is a go-to for me when I want a healthy, protein-packed meal.</description>
