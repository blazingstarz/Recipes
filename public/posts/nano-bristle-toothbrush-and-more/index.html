I\u0026rsquo;ve tried your standard brands like Colgate, Braun, Crest and even the boutique brands you find at Wholefoods or natural health stores. I\u0026rsquo;ve even been a been a long time user of the Sonicare and Oral B brush systems. But then I discovered the brush that changed everything in 2022\u0026ndash;the nano bristle brush that has 20,000 ultra soft nano strands that can really give you that squeaky clean smile.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022the-nano-bristle-toothbrush-is-the-best\u0022\u003eThe nano bristle toothbrush is the best\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/amzn.to\/3RgkVxZ\u0022\u003enano brush #ad\u003c\/a\u003e is different from all the others I\u0026rsquo;ve tried. It has 20,000 ultra-soft nano strands that can really give you that squeaky clean feeling after brushing. The brush is so soft that it won\u0026rsquo;t damage your enamel like hard bristles can. And because of the density of the bristles, these brushes can clear the toughest debris and biofilms in your mouth with ease. In fact, I noticed how effective the brush was at cleaning my teeth that I decided to try it as a spot cleaner for delicate materials and fabrics.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022double-stranded-floss-picks-are-very-effective\u0022\u003eDouble stranded floss picks are very effective\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second major component of my dental hygiene routine is flossing. I used to use traditional floss and it was really a pain, bu tI\u0026rsquo;ve found that using picks are much easier. My favorite type is \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DhPfCQ\u0022\u003edual strand floss picks #ad\u003c\/a\u003e. These picks are definitely more effective at pulling out any salad or food particles stuck in the teeth. I even carry a pack in my car just in case I eat out.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022dental-water-picks-are-very-effective\u0022\u003eDental water picks are very effective\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt home, I also use a \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/amzn.to\/3JtV3N8\u0022\u003ewater pick #ad\u003c\/a\u003e. These give the mouth a great feeling and can help flush out anything that the floss picks and brushing will miss. The water pick is a powerful device that uses a stream of water to clean between your teeth, reaching places that traditional flossing cannot. It is also great for people who have difficulty using traditional floss, such as those with arthritis or mobility issues.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022the-tongue-scraper-is-important-for-fresh-breath\u0022\u003eThe tongue scraper is important for fresh breath\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important aspect of my oral hygiene routine is using a \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/amzn.to\/3j8DuaX\u0022\u003etongue scraper #ad\u003c\/a\u003e. A tongue scraper is a small tool that is used to scrape the surface of the tongue, removing bacteria and other debris that can cause bad breath. The benefits of using a tongue scraper are many. It can help to remove bacteria that can cause bad breath, reduce the risk of tooth decay and gum disease, and even improve the sense of taste. Plus, it is a quick and easy addition to my morning routine.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022natural-mouthwash-with-neem-to-maintain-breath\u0022\u003eNatural mouthwash with neem to maintain breath\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone serious about maintaining fresh breath needs to have a \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DI429S\u0022\u003egood mouthwash #ad\u003c\/a\u003e that\u0026rsquo;s used throughout the day. My favorite ones leave the mouth refreshed and nourished. I tend to go with one that has auruvedic botanicals like neem and aloe. Neem has been used for medicinal purposes by Indians for many millennia and has quickly gained popularity in the western world. Neem is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. It can help to reduce plaque and prevent tooth decay. Aloe, on the other hand, is known for its soothing properties and can help to reduce inflammation in the gums.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022neem-in-dental-care\u0022\u003eNeem in dental care\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main ingredients I look for in my dental hygiene products is neem. Are you even a natural toothpaste brand if you don\u0026rsquo;t have neem in your ingredients? Actually, as an Indian, neem occasionally finds its way into my diet. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely an acquired tastes. Newcomers take care when \u003ca href=\u0022https:\/\/amzn.to\/3RzgLRX\u0022\u003etrying it #ad\u003c\/a\u003e\u0026hellip; Actually, one of my grandfather\u0026rsquo;s uncles used to have the brightest and whitest teeth in his village in India and it was because he regularly chewed on neem leaves and twigs. He claimed that it helped to keep his teeth and gums healthy, and it all makes sense now.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\u0022regular-dental-checkups-are-important\u0022\u003eRegular dental checkups are important\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to my daily oral hygiene routine, I also make sure to see my dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings. And I make sure to practice good oral hygiene habits, such as not smoking, limiting sugary and acidic foods, and avoiding alcohol.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, maintaining a consistent oral hygiene routine and using the right products can make all the difference in achieving and maintaining a healthy mouth. The nano bristle brush, floss picks, water pick, tongue scraper, and mouthwash with auruvedic botanicals have all been game changers for me, and I highly recommend giving them a try. And remember, a healthy mouth leads to a healthy body, so don\u0026rsquo;t neglect your oral hygiene.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/span\u003e", "activity-content", contentDelay);
