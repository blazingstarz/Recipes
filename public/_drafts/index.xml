      <description>Ingredients 500 g Small, kochi potol (pointed gourd)
20 g Vegetable oil
2 pcs Cardamom
2 pcs Cloves
1 pc Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Cumin powder
1/4 tsp Turmeric
200 g Hot milk
6 g Salt
8 g Sugar
5 g Ghee
Directions Peel the potol entirely. Even though our other potol recipes call for removing peels in alternating strips, for this recipe, we want the potol fully peeled so that it soaks up the curry and becomes juicy.</description>
